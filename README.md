## ✨ Features

- **Automated Analysis**: Runs Slither on every push and pull request.
- **Persistent Results**: Saves analysis results as a committed file.
- **Downloadable Artifacts**: Makes the analysis available as a downloadable artifact.
- **Simplified Configuration**: Ideal for users without access to GitHub Advanced Security (SARIF feature).

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with Solidity contracts.
- Familiarity with GitHub Actions (for custom modifications, if any).

## 🛠 Integration Steps

1. Navigate to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. Create a new YAML file (e.g., `slither-analysis.yml`).
3. Copy and paste the provided workflow script into this YAML file.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. The workflow will now be activated and run the Slither analysis on every push and pull request.

## 📜 Workflow Breakdown

- **Checkout Repository**: Checks out the latest code.
- **Run Slither Analysis**: Executes Slither targeting the 'Contracts' directory.
- **Save Analysis to File**: Stores the results in `slither-output.txt`.
- **Upload as Artifact**: Provides the Slither output as an artifact named 'slither-report'.

## 🛠 Customizing the Analysis with Printers

Slither offers various "printers" which can generate additional reports, diagrams, or specific information regarding the smart contract. To customize your analysis, you can utilize these printers by adding them to the `slither-args` field in the workflow. For a full list of available printers and their functionalities, refer to the [official Slither documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither).
